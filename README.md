# Use-of-Computational-Intelligence-to-detect-anomalous-network-events
With the massification of computational resources and the emergence of increasingly sophisticated services, network management has become an increasingly complex activity, because of anomalous events in networks. This research aims to detect Distributed Denial of Service attacks in a database provided by the University of New Brunswick, using Unsupervised Machine Learning. Using three kinds of algorithms: Hierarchical, Based on the Quadratic Error Metric and Density-Based, it was concluded that for the problem in question, the ones that obtained the best results were the first two, while for the third one, there was some difficulty in identifying the attacks.
